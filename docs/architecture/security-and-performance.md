# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' vercel.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:;`
- XSS Prevention: Content sanitization, React's built-in XSS protection, input validation
- Secure Storage: Secure HTTP-only cookies for auth tokens, no sensitive data in localStorage

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Pydantic models for request validation, SQL injection prevention
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP, 1000 requests/hour per authenticated user
- CORS Policy: `origins: ["https://xm-port.com", "https://staging.xm-port.com"]`

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: HTTP-only secure cookies with SameSite=Strict
- Session Management: JWT with 15-minute expiry, refresh tokens with 7-day expiry
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements enforced

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <500KB initial, <2MB total
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting by route, lazy loading for heavy components
- Caching Strategy: Static assets cached 1 year, API responses cached 5 minutes

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <200ms for API calls, <2 seconds for AI processing
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling, query optimization, proper indexing
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session data, query results cached 15 minutes
