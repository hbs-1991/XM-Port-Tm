# Problem Statement

  Customs brokers in former Soviet countries waste 2-3 minutes per product line manually:
  - Searching for appropriate HS codes
  - Entering product details into ASYCUDA
  - Formatting data for XML submission
  - Cross-referencing classification databases

  Impact: A typical broker processing 100 products daily loses 3-5 hours on manual data entry.
