### Data Models for File Upload
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**ProcessingJob Model:**
```typescript
interface ProcessingJob {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'PROCESSING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED' | 'CANCELLED';
  inputFileName: string;
  inputFileUrl: string;           // S3 storage URL
  inputFileSize: number;          // File size in bytes
  outputXmlUrl: string | null;
  creditsUsed: number;
  totalProducts: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  startedAt: Date | null;
  completedAt: Date | null;
}
```

**User Credit System:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  creditsRemaining: number;       // Available processing credits
  creditsUsedThisMonth: number;   // Monthly usage tracking
  subscriptionTier: 'FREE' | 'BASIC' | 'PREMIUM' | 'ENTERPRISE';
}
```

### File Upload Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 (Latest) - Scalable file storage with CDN integration
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI 0.108+ - High-performance async Python with multipart upload support  
- **Frontend State**: React Query 5.0+ - Server state management for file upload progress
- **File Processing**: Python libraries for CSV/XLSX parsing (pandas, openpyxl)
- **Validation**: Pydantic 2.5+ - Data validation and settings management

### API Specifications for File Upload
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Backend File Locations:**
- `/apps/api/src/api/v1/processing.py` - File processing endpoints
- `/apps/api/src/services/file_processing.py` - Business logic for file handling
- `/apps/api/src/schemas/` - Pydantic schemas for file upload validation
- `/apps/api/src/models/processing_job.py` - Database model for processing jobs

**Frontend File Locations:**

- `/apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/ResultsTable.tsx` - Data preview component
- `/apps/web/src/services/` - API client services for file upload

### File Upload Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **File Upload Validation**: Validate file type, size, and structure before processing - prevents system abuse and errors
- **Credit Deduction**: Must be atomic and check balance before processing - prevents race conditions and overselling
- **API Calls**: Never make direct HTTP calls from components - use the service layer for proper error handling and caching
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use the standard error handler - ensures consistent error format across the system

### Security and Performance Constraints
- **File Size Limit**: Maximum 10MB per file to prevent system abuse
- **Supported Formats**: CSV (UTF-8 encoding) and XLSX only
- **Required Columns**: Product Description, Quantity, Unit, Value, Origin Country
- **Virus Scanning**: Implement file scanning before storage (if security service available)
- **Access Controls**: Secure S3 storage with proper IAM permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement upload rate limiting to prevent abuse

### File Processing Architecture
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Upload Endpoint**: `/apps/api/src/api/v1/processing.py` - Handles multipart file uploads
- **File Service**: `/apps/api/src/services/file_processing.py` - File parsing and validation logic
- **Storage Integration**: AWS S3 integration for secure file storage
- **Database Models**: ProcessingJob model to track uploaded files and processing status

### Frontend Component Architecture  
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
**File Upload Component Structure:**
```
components/dashboard/upload/
├── FileUpload.tsx           # Main drag & drop upload interface
├── ProcessingProgress.tsx   # Real-time progress tracking
├── ResultsTable.tsx        # Data preview and editing
└── UploadValidation.tsx    # Real-time validation feedback
```

### WebSocket Integration for Real-time Updates
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
```typescript
// Real-time WebSocket integration for upload progress
export const useUploadProgress = (jobId: string) => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<JobStatus>('PENDING');

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(`/ws/processing?token=${getAuthToken()}`);
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      if (data.jobId === jobId) {
        setProgress(data.progress);
        setStatus(data.status);
      }
    };

    return () => ws.close();
  }, [jobId]);

  return { progress, status };
};
```

### Project Structure Alignment
All file locations align with the defined project structure in source-tree.md. The file upload functionality will be implemented in:
- Backend: `/apps/api/src/api/v1/processing.py` and related service files
- Frontend: `/apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/` directory
- Shared types: `/packages/shared/src/types/processing.ts`

### Technical Integration Requirements
- Credit balance must be checked before allowing file upload
- User authentication must be verified for all upload operations  
- Files must be validated both client-side and server-side
- Upload progress must be tracked and displayed to users
- Uploaded files must be securely stored in S3 with proper access controls
- Processing jobs must be created in database for tracking purposes
