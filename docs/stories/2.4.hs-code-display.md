## Status
**Status**: Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** customs broker and trade compliance officer,  
**I want** to see matched HS codes displayed directly in the file preview spreadsheet after AI processing,  
**so that** I can quickly review and validate the trade classifications before generating XML export declarations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After file upload and HS code matching completes, the preview spreadsheet displays an additional "HS Code" column
2. The HS Code column shows:
   - Primary matched HS code (e.g., "8471.30.00")
   - Confidence indicator badge (High/Medium/Low)
   - Visual styling based on confidence level (green/yellow/red)
3. Users can edit HS codes manually if needed with format validation
4. Alternative HS codes are shown in a tooltip on hover
5. Real-time updates via WebSocket when matching completes
6. Export functionality includes HS codes in downloaded files

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- **Backend**: `apps/api/src/services/hs_matching_service.py` - Contains HS code matching logic with OpenAI integration
- **Backend**: `apps/api/src/models/product_match.py` - ProductMatch model stores HS codes and confidence scores
- **Backend**: `apps/api/src/api/v1/processing.py` - Processing endpoints that need enhancement
- **Backend**: `apps/api/src/api/v1/ws.py` - WebSocket manager for real-time updates
- **Frontend**: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/EditableSpreadsheet.tsx` - Main component requiring updates
- **Frontend**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useProcessingUpdates.ts` - Hook for processing status updates

**Key Architecture Notes:**
- HS code matching already implemented and functional in backend via OpenAI Agents SDK
- ProductMatch model contains: `matched_hs_code`, `confidence_score`, `alternative_hs_codes`, `requires_manual_review`
- WebSocket infrastructure exists (`ws_manager`) for real-time job updates
- Frontend uses Next.js with TypeScript, Radix UI components, and Tailwind CSS
- EditableSpreadsheet already has pagination, validation, and editing capabilities

**Important Implementation Context:**
- HS codes are 6-10 digit codes with optional dots (e.g., "6109.10.00")
- Confidence thresholds: High (≥0.95), Medium (≥0.8), Low (<0.8)
- Alternative codes stored as ARRAY(String) in PostgreSQL
- Current spreadsheet validates numeric fields and cross-field calculations
- WebSocket sends job updates with status changes and progress data

**Critical Dependencies:**
- OpenAI API must be operational for HS code matching
- Redis cache service used for performance optimization
- PostgreSQL database stores ProductMatch records
- WebSocket connection stability required for real-time updates

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- Backend Unit Tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/test_hs_code_display.py`
- Backend Integration Tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/test_processing_api.py`
- Frontend Component Tests: `apps/web/tests/components/dashboard/upload/EditableSpreadsheet.test.tsx`
- E2E Tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/hs-code-display.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Backend**: pytest with asyncio support, FastAPI TestClient
- **Frontend**: Jest with @testing-library/react for component tests
- **E2E**: Playwright for browser automation
- **API Testing**: httpx for async API calls

**Testing Standards:**
- Minimum 85% code coverage for new functionality
- All API endpoints must have unit and integration tests
- Component tests must verify accessibility (ARIA labels)
- WebSocket functionality requires dedicated integration tests
- Performance tests for spreadsheet rendering with large datasets (>1000 rows)

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Test HS code display with various confidence levels
- Validate tooltip functionality for alternative codes
- Test manual HS code editing with validation
- Verify WebSocket real-time updates
- Test export functionality includes HS codes
- Accessibility testing for screen readers
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Mock Data Requirements:**
- ProductMatch records with various confidence scores (0.3, 0.8, 0.95)
- Alternative HS codes arrays for tooltip testing
- WebSocket message payloads for real-time update testing
- Invalid HS code formats for validation testing
