## Dev Notes

### OpenAI Agents SDK Configuration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#OpenAI-Agents-SDK-API]

**FileSearchTool Setup:**
```python
from agents import Agent, FileSearchTool, Runner
from pydantic import Basemodel

class CodeResult(Basemodel)
      hs_code: str,
      code_description: str,
      confidence = float,


# Configure agent with FileSearchTool
agent = Agent(
    name="HS Code Matcher",
    instructions="You are an expert in HS code classification. Match product descriptions to the most appropriate HS codes with confidence scores.",
    tools=[
        FileSearchTool(
            max_num_results=5,
            vector_store_ids=["vs_hs_codes_turkmenistan"],
        ),
    ],
    output_type= CodeResult
)

# Execute matching
async def match_hs_code(product_description: str) -> HSCodeMatch:
    result = await Runner.run(
        agent,
        f"Find the most appropriate HS code for: {product_description}",
    )
    return parse_hs_code_result(result.final_output)
```

### Previous Story Integration
[Source: Story 2.1 - File Upload/Validation]
- File processing pipeline is established with ProductMatch model
- Product data validation is implemented with required fields
- Credit system is integrated for processing costs
- API authentication and authorization patterns are established

### Data Models for HS Code Matching
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#HSCode]

**HSCode Model (External):**
```typescript
interface HSCode {
  code: string;              // HS code identifier
  description: string;        // Official HS code description  
  chapter: string;           // HS chapter classification
  section: string;           // HS section classification
  country: string;          // Country-specific variations
  confidence: number;       // AI matching confidence (0-1)
}
```

**HSCodeMatch Result:**
```typescript
interface HSCodeMatch {
  primaryMatch: HSCode;
  alternativeMatches: HSCode[];
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  processingTime: number;
}
```

### Architecture & Responsibility Division

**OpenAI Agent Responsibilities:**
- Execute semantic search queries against Vector Store via FileSearchTool
- AI-powered product description to HS code matching
- Return structured outputs with confidence scores and alternatives
- Handle OpenAI-specific error handling and retry logic

**Our Backend Service Responsibilities:**
- Provide REST API layer for frontend integration
- Business logic orchestration and workflow management
- Request/response validation with Pydantic schemas
- Performance optimization through Redis caching
- Application-level error handling and logging
- Integration with existing product processing pipeline
- Analytics and monitoring of matching operations

### Technology Stack Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required Technologies:**
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** (Latest): Production-ready AI agent orchestration
- **FileSearchTool**: Built-in vector store integration
- **OpenAI Vector Store**: External managed vector storage (no local database)
- **FastAPI** (0.108+): Async API endpoints for HS code matching
- **Redis** (7.2+): Caching for frequently matched codes
- **Pydantic** (2.5+): Request/response validation

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Backend Implementation:**
- `/apps/api/src/services/hs_matching_service.py` - OpenAI Agent integration & business logic
- `/apps/api/src/services/cache_service.py` - Redis caching for performance optimization
- `/apps/api/src/api/v1/hs_matching.py` - REST API endpoints for frontend integration
- `/apps/api/src/schemas/hs_matching.py` - Pydantic validation schemas
- `/apps/api/src/core/openai_config.py` - OpenAI API & Vector Store configuration

**Note**: No local database migrations needed - HS codes stored in external OpenAI Vector Store

**Frontend Integration:**
- `/packages/shared/src/types/hs_matching.ts` - Shared TypeScript interfaces
- Integration with existing file processing components

### Performance Requirements
- HS code matching must return results in <2 seconds
- Batch processing should handle 100+ products efficiently  
- Cache hit ratio target: >70% for frequently matched descriptions
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse (aligned with OpenAI limits)
- Fallback mechanisms for OpenAI API failures

### Security and Configuration
- Secure storage of OpenAI API credentials in environment variables
- Rate limiting aligned with OpenAI API limits (5,000 RPM, 160,000 TPM)
- Input validation on all product descriptions
- Audit logging for HS code matching operations
- Error handling that doesn't expose API details to users
