### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The project must follow the exact structure defined in the unified project structure:
- `apps/web/` - Next.js frontend with App Router structure
- `apps/api/` - FastAPI backend with service-layer architecture
- `packages/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities
- `packages/ui/` - Shared UI components (shadcn/ui)
- `packages/config/` - Shared configuration files
- `infrastructure/` - AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code
- `scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts

### Development Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7.2+
- Development commands must support concurrent frontend/backend development
- Environment configuration with proper validation
- Docker setup for local development environment

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: All types must be defined in packages/shared
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Frontend: PascalCase components, camelCase hooks
  - Backend: snake_case functions, kebab-case API routes
  - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Root package.json: `/package.json` (workspace configuration)
- Frontend package: `/apps/web/package.json`
- Backend requirements: `/apps/api/requirements.txt`
- Shared types: `/packages/shared/src/types/`
- Environment template: `/.env.example`
- Docker configuration: `/docker-compose.yml`
- CI/CD workflows: `/.github/workflows/`

## Testing

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Frontend Tests Location**: `apps/web/tests/`
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/components/`, `apps/web/tests/hooks/`, `apps/web/tests/utils/`

**Backend Tests Location**: `apps/api/tests/`
- Unit tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/services/`, `apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/api/`, `apps/api/tests/integration/database/`

**Testing Frameworks**:
- Frontend: Jest 29+ with React Testing Library 14+
- Backend: pytest 7+ with httpx 0.25+
- E2E: Playwright 1.40+

**Test Standards**:
- All tests must follow the testing pyramid structure
- Example tests must be created for each testing layer
- Test coverage reporting must be configured
- Tests must use proper mocking for external dependencies

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety across entire stack
- Next.js 15.1+ with App Router (not Pages Router)
- FastAPI 0.108+ for async Python web framework
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension for vector search
- All components must integrate with Tailwind CSS
- Authentication must use NextAuth.js 4.24+
