- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.40+ for cross-browser component testing

### Component Architecture Pattern  
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
**Shared Components Directory Structure:**
```
components/
└── shared/                      # Shared between all sections
    ├── ui/                      # shadcn/ui components
    │   ├── button.tsx
    │   ├── input.tsx
    │   ├── card.tsx
    │   └── ...
    └── navigation/
        ├── Header.tsx
        ├── Footer.tsx
        └── Sidebar.tsx
```

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Frontend Component Files:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/shared/ui/` - shadcn/ui base components
- `/apps/web/src/components/shared/` - Custom shared components
- `/apps/web/src/lib/` - Frontend utilities and configuration
- `/apps/web/src/styles/` - Global styles and theme configuration
- `/apps/web/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `/apps/web/components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration

**Configuration Files:**
- `/packages/config/tailwind/base.js` - Shared Tailwind configuration
- `/packages/ui/src/components/` - Shared UI components package
- `/packages/ui/src/styles/` - Component styles

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum for all base components
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive components
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Focus management and visual focus indicators
- Color contrast compliance for all design tokens

### Theme Configuration
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#frontend-security]
- Dark/light theme support with system preference detection
- CSS custom properties for theme variables
- Theme persistence with localStorage
- Theme provider component for context management

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Frontend component tests: `/apps/web/tests/components/ui/`
- Visual regression tests: `/apps/web/tests/visual/`
- E2E component tests: `/apps/web/tests/e2e/components.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Frontend: Jest 29+ with React Testing Library 14+ for component unit tests
- E2E: Playwright 1.40+ for cross-browser component testing
- Accessibility: @testing-library/jest-dom for accessibility assertions

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all UI components with props validation
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe or similar
- Visual regression testing for component styling
- Keyboard navigation testing for interactive components
- Theme switching testing (dark/light mode)
- Responsive behavior testing across breakpoints

### Project Structure Alignment
All component locations align with the defined project structure in source-tree.md. The UI framework will be built in the packages/ui directory for shared components and apps/web/src/components/shared/ for Next.js specific implementations.

### Critical Integration Notes
- Authentication components from Story 1.3 will need to be refactored to use the new UI framework components
- Zustand state management patterns are established and should be maintained
- NextAuth.js integration must be preserved during UI framework implementation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation: GOOD** - The UI framework has been successfully implemented with shadcn/ui components and proper Tailwind CSS configuration. The implementation follows the project architecture and includes proper TypeScript support. However, there are several gaps in testing coverage and accessibility validation that need attention.

**Strengths:**
- Clean component architecture following shadcn/ui patterns
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- Theme configuration with dark/light mode support
- Responsive design utilities properly configured
- Component composition patterns well implemented

**Areas Needing Improvement:**
- Missing accessibility testing library (jest-axe)
- Limited test coverage (only Button component has tests)
- No visual regression testing setup
- Missing documentation/Storybook setup
- Several components lack comprehensive unit tests

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as the existing code follows good patterns. The main issues are missing implementations rather than code quality problems.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Components follow TypeScript best practices and project conventions
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper directory structure as specified in source-tree.md
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Incomplete - missing tests for most components
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ Several acceptance criteria partially met

### Acceptance Criteria Analysis

1. **shadcn/ui component library installed** ✓ - Properly configured with components.json
2. **Basic UI components set up** ✓ - Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Form, Table, Toast components present
3. **Design system foundations** ✓ - CSS variables and Tailwind config properly set up
4. **Shared component directory structure** ✓ - Follows specified architecture
5. **Component documentation** ✗ - No Storybook or documentation found
6. **Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)** ⚠️ - Components have basic accessibility but no jest-axe testing
7. **Dark/light theme support** ✓ - Theme provider and CSS variables configured
8. **Responsive design utilities** ✓ - Tailwind breakpoints and container configured
9. **Component testing framework** ✗ - Only Button component has tests, jest-axe not installed

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues (Must Fix):**
- [ ] Install jest-axe for accessibility testing
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all UI components (Input, Card, Dialog, Form, Table, Toast)
- [ ] Implement accessibility tests with jest-axe for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Create E2E tests for component interactions in `/apps/web/tests/e2e/components.spec.ts`

**Important Improvements:**
- [ ] Set up Storybook or similar documentation system for component examples
- [ ] Add visual regression testing setup (as mentioned in AC but not implemented)
- [ ] Create usage documentation for each component
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation tests for all interactive components

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Consider adding more component variants (sizes, colors)
- [ ] Add animation tests for toast notifications
- [ ] Create component composition examples

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities identified. Components properly handle user inputs and don't expose sensitive data. Form validation is handled through react-hook-form which provides good security practices.

### Performance Considerations

- Components use React.forwardRef appropriately for performance
- Tailwind CSS provides optimal bundle size with tree-shaking
- class-variance-authority (cva) used efficiently for variant management
- Consider implementing code splitting for larger components in future iterations

### Testing Gaps Analysis

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- Input component: No tests for validation states, disabled state, or accessibility
- Card component: No tests at all
- Dialog component: No tests for modal behavior, focus trapping, or keyboard navigation
- Form component: No tests for validation, submission, or field interactions
- Table component: No tests for data display, sorting, or pagination
- Toast component: No tests for notifications, auto-dismiss, or stacking

**Required Test Scenarios Not Covered:**
- Cross-browser testing with Playwright
- Theme switching functionality tests
- Responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Component composition patterns
- Error boundary testing

### Files Modified During Review

None - Issues identified require developer action rather than direct fixes.

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1 → Implementation**: shadcn/ui installed ✓
- Evidence: components.json, package dependencies

**AC2 → Tests**: Basic UI components ⚠️
- Button: Has basic tests
- Other components: Missing tests

**AC3 → Implementation**: Design tokens ✓
- Evidence: globals.css with CSS variables, Tailwind config

**AC4 → Implementation**: Directory structure ✓
- Evidence: /apps/web/src/components/shared/ui/

**AC5 → Tests**: Documentation ✗
- No evidence of Storybook or documentation

**AC6 → Tests**: Accessibility ⚠️
- Components have ARIA support but no jest-axe validation

**AC7 → Implementation**: Theme support ✓
- Evidence: ThemeProvider component, CSS variables

**AC8 → Implementation**: Responsive utilities ✓
- Evidence: Tailwind config with breakpoints

**AC9 → Tests**: Testing framework ✗
- Only 1 of 7 components has tests

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Accessibility compliance cannot be verified without jest-axe
- Missing tests create regression risk for UI components

**Medium Risk:**
- No documentation makes component usage unclear for other developers
- Visual regression testing gap could lead to UI inconsistencies

**Low Risk:**
- Performance optimizations can be added incrementally

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.4-basic-ui-framework.yml
- Critical testing gaps prevent PASS status
- Implementation is solid but verification is incomplete

### Recommended Status
