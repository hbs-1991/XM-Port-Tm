## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.3 - Authentication System]
- Authentication components (LoginForm, SignupForm, AuthModal) are already implemented using basic HTML forms
- Zustand store pattern is established for state management
- NextAuth.js integration is complete and working
- TypeScript interfaces are synchronized between frontend/backend
- Component testing patterns are established with Jest and React Testing Library

### Design System Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui + Headless UI (Latest) - Accessible, customizable component library with perfect Tailwind integration
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development and responsive design
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.1+ with App Router for unified component architecture
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ for client state management (already established)

### Technology Stack for UI Framework
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.3+ for type-safe component development
- **Build Tool**: npm 10+ for package management
- **Bundler**: Turbopack (Next.js 15 built-in) for fast development builds
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest 29+ with React Testing Library 14+ for component testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.40+ for cross-browser component testing

### Component Architecture Pattern  
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
**Shared Components Directory Structure:**
```
components/
└── shared/                      # Shared between all sections
    ├── ui/                      # shadcn/ui components
    │   ├── button.tsx
    │   ├── input.tsx
    │   ├── card.tsx
    │   └── ...
    └── navigation/
        ├── Header.tsx
        ├── Footer.tsx
        └── Sidebar.tsx
```

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Frontend Component Files:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/shared/ui/` - shadcn/ui base components
- `/apps/web/src/components/shared/` - Custom shared components
- `/apps/web/src/lib/` - Frontend utilities and configuration
- `/apps/web/src/styles/` - Global styles and theme configuration
- `/apps/web/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `/apps/web/components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration

**Configuration Files:**
- `/packages/config/tailwind/base.js` - Shared Tailwind configuration
- `/packages/ui/src/components/` - Shared UI components package
- `/packages/ui/src/styles/` - Component styles

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum for all base components
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive components
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Focus management and visual focus indicators
- Color contrast compliance for all design tokens

### Theme Configuration
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#frontend-security]
- Dark/light theme support with system preference detection
- CSS custom properties for theme variables
- Theme persistence with localStorage
- Theme provider component for context management

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Frontend component tests: `/apps/web/tests/components/ui/`
- Visual regression tests: `/apps/web/tests/visual/`
- E2E component tests: `/apps/web/tests/e2e/components.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Frontend: Jest 29+ with React Testing Library 14+ for component unit tests
- E2E: Playwright 1.40+ for cross-browser component testing
- Accessibility: @testing-library/jest-dom for accessibility assertions

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all UI components with props validation
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe or similar
- Visual regression testing for component styling
- Keyboard navigation testing for interactive components
- Theme switching testing (dark/light mode)
- Responsive behavior testing across breakpoints

### Project Structure Alignment
All component locations align with the defined project structure in source-tree.md. The UI framework will be built in the packages/ui directory for shared components and apps/web/src/components/shared/ for Next.js specific implementations.

### Critical Integration Notes
- Authentication components from Story 1.3 will need to be refactored to use the new UI framework components
- Zustand state management patterns are established and should be maintained
- NextAuth.js integration must be preserved during UI framework implementation

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Component unit tests: `/apps/web/tests/components/ui/` 
- Component integration tests: `/apps/web/tests/components/shared/`
- E2E component tests: `/apps/web/tests/e2e/components.spec.ts`
- Visual regression tests: `/apps/web/tests/visual/`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest 29+ with React Testing Library 14+ for component unit testing
- Playwright 1.40+ for E2E component testing  
- @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM assertions
- jest-axe for accessibility testing

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Unit tests for all base UI components (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Form, Table, Alert)
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Theme switching tests (dark/light mode functionality)
- Responsive behavior tests across defined breakpoints
- Keyboard navigation tests for interactive components
- Visual regression tests for component styling consistency
- Integration tests for component composition patterns

**Testing Patterns:**
- Mock theme context in component tests
- Test component variants and states comprehensively  
- Test accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles, keyboard navigation)
- Test responsive behavior with different viewport sizes
- Achieve minimum 90% test coverage for UI components
